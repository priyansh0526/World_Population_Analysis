🌍 World Population Analysis
Exploring global population trends and insights using Python and World Bank data

📊 Overview

This project analyzes world population data across countries and regions to uncover key demographic trends — such as the fastest-growing populations, most densely populated regions, and long-term global patterns.

The goal is to use data analytics and visualization to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that can guide policy, economics, and sustainability discussions.

📈 Key Insights

Some major findings from this analysis include:

🌏 Asia contributes to over 60% of the global population.

🇮🇳 India and China consistently remain the top two most populous countries.

📈 Countries in Africa show the highest growth rates, indicating rapid urbanization.

🌐 The global population has grown exponentially since the 1950s, crossing 8 billion in 2023.

🧠 Developed regions show population stabilization, while developing ones show surging growth trends.

📊 Visualizations Included

The notebook contains the following plots and analyses:

Top 10 most populated countries

Population growth trend (1950–2023)
